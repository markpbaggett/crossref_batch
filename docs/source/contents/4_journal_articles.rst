=================================
Minting DOIs for Journal Articles
=================================

Crossref allows you to perform batch registration for journals and the volumes, issues, and articles being registered
within the journal.  Within a journal instance you may register articles from a single issue by adding details to
:code:`journal_issue`. Crossref allows you to register items from more than one issue but to do so you must use
multiple journal instances within the XML file you submit to Crossref.

The documentation below describes what Crossref expects and our approach to batch registration of DOIs for journal
articles.
